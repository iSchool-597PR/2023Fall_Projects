# 2023 Fall Projects from IS597PR

Unfortunately, as has happened in some other semesters, some student(s) still ignored everything I taught them about how to avoid plagiarism. Re-using or adapting sections of code or other materials that are _clearly_ cited to indicate their external source are not plagiarism. So, for your own exploration fun, see if you can identify which student project or projects were significantly plagiarized.

Note: Only the direct forks from this repo created during Fall 2023 semester were submissions as the last part of the coursework. Sometimes other people make forks later on for their own reasons. Also, I encourage projects in the course to be adaptations/expansions/improvements built on or rewriting prior work others had done before (in this course or anywhere else).  When that was authorized and done properly, their materials will clearly reference the original materials used.
