    """Returns a small world network graph, expanded using Barabási–Albert preferential attachment

    A graph of $n$ nodes is grown by attaching new nodes each with $m$
    edges that are preferentially attached to existing nodes with high degree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of nodes
    m : int
        Number of edges to attach from a new node to existing nodes
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
    initial_graph : Graph or None (default)
        Initial network for Barabási–Albert algorithm.
        It should be a connected graph for most use cases.
        A copy of `initial_graph` is used.
        If None, starts from a star graph on (m+1) nodes.

    Returns
    -------
    G : Graph

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `m` does not satisfy ``1 <= m < n``, or
        the initial graph number of nodes m0 does not satisfy ``m <= m0 <= n``.
